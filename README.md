**About:** 
&nbsp;

I am self-teaching the content of CSE 477 to develop the necessary technical skills and proficiency in technologies relevant to full-stack web development. 

As of January 2022, I am not taking this class officially through Michigan State University.

The content in this repository will be personal notes derived from a [previous semester version](https://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~cse477/) of the course as I follow the lectures and complete the assignments openly sourced.
